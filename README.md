**search dezeen.com interior library for specific objects and colours**

*by Adam Siemaszkiewicz*


# Summary

The idea behind this repo is to speed up an interior architect's workflow by allowing to search through the interior image dataset of [Dezeen.com] online architecture magazine. You can either search by a type of object or a colour. Currently, the Dezeen.com's dataset does not provide such feature, so I implemented a object detection and dominant colour detection algorithms to properly tag the image dataset and allow for a proof-of-concept search engine.
